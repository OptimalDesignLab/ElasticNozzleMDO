AERO STRUCTURAL MULTIDISCIPLINARY ANALYSIS PROGRAM

Ongoing work on coupling Alp Dener's computational structural mechanics program 
(2D beam) with Prof. Jason Hicken's Quasi 1D Euler flow solver.

COMPILING AERO STRUCTURAL MDA:

BOOST_HOME and KONA_HOME environment variables must be set to Boost includes
directory and Kona root directory respectively. If dependencies are installed
properly, the test solver MDA_test.bin should compile.

DEPENDENCIES:
+ Boost
+ Kona (https://bitbucket.org/jehicken/kona)

DESIGN NOTES:

+ Bspline::EvalAtPoints will give a vector of Y coordinates
that correspond to a vector of X coordinates on the Bspline.
Use this to create the mesh.

+ Use Bspline::FitCurve to generate analytical Bspline from
a set of X and Y coordinates. The optimizer will control only
the Bspline, not the mesh coordinates.

MAJOR ISSUES:

+ System residual is returning NaN. CSM residual has been independently verified.
CFD residual might be the problem.
