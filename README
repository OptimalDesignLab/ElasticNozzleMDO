AERO STRUCTURAL MULTIDISCIPLINARY ANALYSIS PROGRAM

Ongoing work on coupling Alp Dener's computational structural mechanics program 
(2D beam) with Prof. Jason Hicken's Quasi 1D Euler flow solver.

DESIGN NOTES:

+ Bspline::EvalAtPoints will give a vector of Y coordinates
that correspond to a vector of X coordinates on the Bspline.
Use this to create the mesh.

+ Use Bspline::FitCurve to generate analytical Bspline from
a set of X and Y coordinates. The optimizer will control only
the Bspline, not the mesh coordinates.

MAJOR ISSUES:

+ Assemble the system preconditioner.

+ Figure out how to find the system residual L2 norm.

+ Clear up the operator(this) calls. How do they work?

+ Review CSM gradients.

+ Review the calculation of system residual.
